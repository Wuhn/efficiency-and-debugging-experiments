2	For be a man ' s intellectual superiority what it will , it can never assume the practical , available supremacy over other men , without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments , always , in themselves , more or less paltry and base .
0	Now , then , come the grand divisions of the entire whale host .
2	In old England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen , and made garter - knights of ; but , be YOUR boast , Stubb , that ye were kicked by old Ahab , and made a wise man of .
0	Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the English and the right whale of the Americans .
1	While yet some distance from the Pequod , she rounded to , and dropping a boat , her captain was impelled towards us , impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern .
1	poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat , remorselessly dragged there by the line , which had taken several turns around his chest and neck .
2	It ' s queer ; very queer ; and he ' s queer too ; aye , take him fore and aft , he ' s about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with .
1	From the boat ' s fragmentary stern , Fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him ; the clinging crew , at the other drifting end , could not succor him ; more than enough was it for them to look to themselves .
0	In the length he attains , and in his baleen , the Fin - back resembles the right whale , but is of a less portly girth , and a lighter colour , approaching to olive .
0	Here have I been unconsciously toiling , not pleasuring -- aye , and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while ; to windward , and with such nervous whiffs , as if , like the dying whale , my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble .
1	Caught and twisted -- corkscrewed in the mazes of the line , loose harpoons and lances , with all their bristling barbs and points , came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab ' s boat .
1	The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open - doored marble tomb ; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar , Ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition .
0	Moreover , in the infancy of the first Australian settlement , the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whale - ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters .
2	But it is only found on the sinister side , which has an ill effect , giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left - handed man .
1	As with Fedallah the day before , so Ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boat ' s broken half , which afforded a comparatively easy float ; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day ' s mishap .
1	But as if perceiving this stratagem , Moby Dick , with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him , sidelingly transplanted himself , as it were , in an instant , shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat .
1	Issuing from the cabin , Stubb now called his boat ' s crew , and pulled off for the stranger .
0	Nothing was done , and nothing seemed capable of being done ; those on deck rushed towards the bows , and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale .
2	More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving , grew the countenance of the old man at every shout ; while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other , as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions .
2	No , you were kicked by a great man , and with a beautiful ivory leg , Stubb .
1	" Lower away ," he cried , so soon as he had reached his boat -- a spare one , rigged the afternoon previous .
0	Was the other one lost by a whale ?"
1	Setting sail to the rising wind , the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to leeward , by both oars and canvas .
2	More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look , which , in any other man , would have soon flowered out in a smile .
1	His boat ' s crew were all in high excitement , eagerly helping their chief , and looking as anxious as gold - hunters .
0	What then is the whale , which I include in the second species of my Folios ?
0	The whale - ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony .
0	It had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whale ' s jaw .
2	With one mind , their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man ' s knife , as he carved the chief dish before him .
1	He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a half - splintering shock .
2	( QUIETLY SMOKING ) That ' s a white man ; he calls that fun : humph !
2	Well , the best thing you can do , Flask , is to let the old man alone ; never speak to him , whatever he says .
2	The crew , man , the crew !
2	If man will strike , strike through the mask !
1	Halloo , here ' s grass growing in the boat ' s bottom -- and by the Lord , the mast there ' s budding .
2	But when a man suspects any wrong , it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter , he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself .
2	Old age is always wakeful ; as if , the longer linked with life , the less man has to do with aught that looks like death .
2	" Young man , you ' d better ship for a missionary , instead of a fore - mast hand ; I never heard a better sermon .
0	I know , too , that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale , he ' s been a kind of moody -- desperate moody , and savage sometimes ; but that will all pass off .
0	good people all ,-- the Greenland whale is deposed ,-- the great sperm whale now reigneth !
0	And so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived .
1	Think you I let that chance go , without using my boat - hatchet and jack - knife , and breaking the seal and reading all the contents of that young cub ?
2	Curious to tell , this imperial negro , Ahasuerus Daggoo , was the Squire of little Flask , who looked like a chess - man beside him .
1	It was hard upon high noon ; and Ahab , seated in the bows of his high - hoisted boat , was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude .
0	the FIN - BACK WHALE ; IV .
2	It is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a great secret in him ."
0	well , spose him one whale eye , well , den !"
0	Next : how shall we define the whale , by his obvious externals , so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come ?
0	" They didn ' t tell much of anything about him ; only I ' ve heard that he ' s a good whale - hunter , and a good captain to his crew ."
0	But , though the world scouts at us whale hunters , yet does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage ; yea , an all - abounding adoration !
2	All visible objects , man , are but as pasteboard masks .
0	The whale has no famous author , and whaling no famous chronicler , you will say .
2	Now , the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea , is this -- the first lives aft , the last forward .
1	These last three were brought alongside ere nightfall ; but the windward one could not be reached till morning ; and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night ; and that boat was Ahab ' s .
2	As no better man advances to take this matter in hand , I hereupon offer my own poor endeavors .
1	Though lifted to the very top of the cranes , the windward quarter boat ( Ahab ' s ) did not escape .
1	Soon all the boats but Starbuck ' s were dropped ; all the boat - sails set -- all the paddles plying ; with rippling swiftness , shooting to leeward ; and Ahab heading the onset .
2	" Come along , Queequeg , let ' s leave this crazy man .
0	Who , but no less a prince than Alfred the Great , who , with his own royal pen , took down the words from Other , the Norwegian whale - hunter of those times !
0	And how pleasing to God was this conduct in Jonah , is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale .
1	And that same day , too , gazing far down from his boat ' s side into that same golden sea , Starbuck lowly murmured :--
1	It is often the case that when a boat is stove , its crew , being picked up by another boat , help to work that second boat ; and the chase is thus continued with what is called double - banked oars .
0	It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen ; and the oil specially known as " whale oil ," an inferior article in commerce .
0	Don ' t whale it too much a ' Lord ' s days , men ; but don ' t miss a fair chance either , that ' s rejecting Heaven ' s good gifts .
1	But Ahab heard nothing ; for his own voice was high - lifted then ; and the boat leaped on .
1	Drawn into the waiting boat , they were quickly brought to the deck ; but Tashtego was long in coming to , and Queequeg did not look very brisk .
0	It was the idea also , that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses .
1	Seizing his sharp boat - spade , he commenced an excavation in the body , a little behind the side fin .
2	Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out .
2	" Young man ," said Bildad sternly , " thou art skylarking with me -- explain thyself , thou young Hittite .
2	I account that man more honourable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns .
2	He looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion , as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety .
2	" And it ' s said very well , and I like to hear a chap talk up that way ; you are just the man for him -- the likes of ye .
1	Aye ," lighting from the boat to the deck , " thus I trample on thee , thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high ; thus I split and destroy thee !"
2	He was a long , earnest man , and though born on an icy coast , seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes , his flesh being hard as twice - baked biscuit .
0	Thus speak of the whale , the great Cuvier , and John Hunter , and Lesson , those lights of zoology and anatomy .
0	It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera , that I would now fain put before you .
1	How to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say , unless by administering three or four boat loads of Brandreth ' s pills , and then running out of harm ' s way , as laborers do in blasting rocks .
1	Some hands now jumped into a boat alongside , and pushed a little off from the ship .
0	He sees no black sky and raging sea , feels not the reeling timbers , and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale , which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him .
0	The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length , with reference to elucidating the sperm whale .
0	It was of a conical shape , some ten feet high ; consisting of the long , huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the right - whale .
2	Yet , this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived , by what a grey Manxman insinuated , an old sepulchral man , who , having never before sailed out of Nantucket , had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab .
2	Flask was the last person down at the dinner , and Flask is the first man up .
1	A few keen pulls , and his boat - hook soon clinched the Pequod ' s main - chains , and he sprang to the deck .
2	Talk not to me of blasphemy , man ; I ' d strike the sun if it insulted me .
0	Those books are Beale ' s and Bennett ' s ; both in their time surgeons to English South - Sea whale - ships , and both exact and reliable men .
0	There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you , and at the same time , in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt .
1	the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat I stand in , that thing I harpoon .
1	The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks , leaving a narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths .
1	down the rest of the spare boats and rig them -- Mr . Starbuck away , and muster the boat ' s crews ."
2	He looked like a man cut away from the stake , when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them , or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness .
1	The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him , as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus ' s elephants in the book of Maccabees .
0	But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale , compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning .
1	At any rate -- though indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptive -- spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon .
0	As the type of the FOLIO I present the SPERM WHALE ; of the OCTAVO , the GRAMPUS ; of the DUODECIMO , the PORPOISE .
0	All round , her unpanelled , open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw , with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale , inserted there for pins , to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to .
2	A staid , steadfast man , whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action , and not a tame chapter of sounds .
2	But not my master , man , is even that fair play .
0	Yet even then beyond the reach of any plummet --' out of the belly of hell '-- when the whale grounded upon the ocean ' s utmost bones , even then , God heard the engulphed , repenting prophet when he cried .
1	A great rolling sea , dashing high up against the reeling ship ' s high teetering side , stove in the boat ' s bottom at the stern , and left it again , all dripping through like a sieve .
0	For some of these same Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale - hunters .
2	I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man , who in mid - winter just landed from a four years ' dangerous voyage , could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term .
0	THE WHALE NEVER FIGURED IN ANY GRAND IMPOSING WAY ?
2	In truth , a mature man who uses hair - oil , unless medicinally , that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere .
0	As yet , however , the sperm whale , scientific or poetic , lives not complete in any literature .
2	The living member -- that makes the living insult , my little man .
0	" Now ," said Queequeg , quietly hauling in the line , " spos - ee him whale - e eye ; why , dad whale dead ."
2	There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him ; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress .
0	When close to the whale , in the very death - lock of the fight , he handled his unpitying lance coolly and off - handedly , as a whistling tinker his hammer .
2	" He ' s a lively chief mate , that ; good man , and a pious ; but all alive now , I must turn to ."
1	" I will wager something now ," whispered Stubb to Flask , " that some one in that missing boat wore off that Captain ' s best coat ; mayhap , his watch -- he ' s so cursed anxious to get it back .
2	That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves , so far within us , that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone ; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valor - ruined man .
1	But to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible , he swam so fast and furious .
2	Three better , more likely sea - officers and men , each in his own different way , could not readily be found , and they were every one of them Americans ; a Nantucketer , a Vineyarder , a Cape man .
1	Our boat was furnished with three of them .
2	For what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of God !
1	As on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jolly - boat , your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled .
0	Reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days , will satisfy you that the Greenland whale , without one rival , was to them the monarch of the seas .
1	Often he would be surrounded by an eager circle , all waiting to be served ; holding boat - spades , pike - heads , harpoons , and lances , and jealously watching his every sooty movement , as he toiled .
2	he then said , turning to me ; " not very long , I rather guess , young man ."
0	The whale himself has never figured in any grand imposing way .
2	Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man , Stubb was speechless a moment ; then said excitedly , " I am not used to be spoken to that way , sir ; I do but less than half like it , sir ."
0	in my desk , then here I prospectively ascribe all the honour and the glory to whaling ; for a whale - ship was my Yale College and my Harvard .
0	If that double - bolted land , Japan , is ever to become hospitable , it is the whale - ship alone to whom the credit will be due ; for already she is on the threshold .
1	In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern .
0	On the separate subject of the Greenland or right - whale , he is the best existing authority .
1	now mark his boat there ; where is that stove ?
0	the HUMP - BACKED WHALE ; V . the RAZOR - BACK WHALE ; VI .
2	In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the mast - head ; nay , to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful .
0	The original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small ; but so far as it goes , it is of excellent quality , though mostly confined to scientific description .
1	Snatching the boat - knife from its sheath , he suspended its sharp edge over the line , and turning towards Stubb , exclaimed interrogatively , " Cut ?"
0	THE WHALE NO FAMOUS AUTHOR , AND WHALING NO FAMOUS CHRONICLER ?
1	In striking at a boat , he swiftly curves away his flukes from it , and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil .
2	He was a native of Cape Cod ; and hence , according to local usage , was called a Cape - Cod - man .
2	But it ' s made a wise man of me , Flask .
1	The substance was , Never jump from a boat , Pip , except -- but all the rest was indefinite , as the soundest advice ever is .
1	No boat - knife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern .
2	You know the old man ' s ivory leg , well I dreamed he kicked me with it ; and when I tried to kick back , upon my soul , my little man , I kicked my leg right off !
1	The gaff is something like a boat - hook .
1	But starting from his enchantment , Gardiner silently hurried to the side ; more fell than stepped into his boat , and returned to his ship .
0	If American and European men - of - war now peacefully ride in once savage harbors , let them fire salutes to the honour and glory of the whale - ship , which originally showed them the way , and first interpreted between them and the savages .
1	He then called for his harpoon , had the wooden stock drawn from it , and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat .
1	In long Indian file , as when herons take wing , the white birds were now all flying towards Ahab ' s boat ; and when within a few yards began fluttering over the water there , wheeling round and round , with joyous , expectant cries .
0	And here be it said , that the Greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas .
2	It was merely the condensation of the man .
2	For sleeping man , ' twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights .
2	By this , he seemed to mean , not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril , but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward .
1	Thus , some minds for ever keep trimming boat .
1	And yesterday I talked the same to Starbuck there , concerning my broken boat .
